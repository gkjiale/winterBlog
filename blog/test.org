* 使用org和Jekyll来写博客

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Jekyll is a static web site generator written in Ruby. It can transform various text markups, using a templating language, into static html. The resulting site can be served by almost any web server without requiring additional components such as php. Jekyll is the tool used to produce Github's pages.

This article discusses how to produce both a static site and a blog using Jekyll and org. Rather than writing a markup processor for org files, I have relied on org's html export features to generate files that can be processed by Jekyll.

Org already has an excellent html export engine. However, it lacks built in support for blogging. Using Jekyll also gives more control over the final appearance of your site.
